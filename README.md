 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a deep learning–based image classification system to identify plant diseases from leaf images. Early and accurate detection of plant diseases is crucial for improving crop yield and supporting sustainable agriculture. The model leverages transfer learning to achieve reliable performance even with limited training data.

 Approach & Methodology

Utilized the PlantVillage dataset, containing labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

Applied transfer learning using EfficientNet, allowing the model to benefit from pre-trained image representations.

Performed data preprocessing and augmentation techniques such as resizing, normalization, and random transformations to improve generalization.

Fine-tuned the model on the target dataset to adapt it to plant disease classification.
